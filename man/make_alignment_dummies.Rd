\title{Prepare dummy data to visually align a single gene across faceted molecules}
\usage{
make_alignment_dummies(data, mapping, on, side = "left")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame of genes. This is almost certainly the same data frame
that will later be passed to `ggplot2::ggplot`.}

\item{mapping}{Aesthetic mapping, created with `ggplot2::aes`. Must contain
the following aesthetics: `xmin`, `xmax`, `y`, and `id` (a unique identifier
for each gene).}

\item{on}{Name of gene to be visually aligned across facets. This gene must
be present in 'data', in the column mapped to the `id` aesthetic.}

\item{side}{Should the visual alignment be of the `left` (default) or `right`
side of the gene?}
}
\description{
`make_alignment_dummies` helps you to visually align genes across molecules
that have been faceted with a free x scale. The output of this function is a
data frame of dummy genes. If these dummy genes are added to a 'ggplot2' plot
with `geom_blank`, they will extend the x axis range in such a way that the
start or end of a selected gene is visually aligned across the facets.
}
\examples{

dummies <- make_alignment_dummies(example_genes, ggplot2::aes(xmin = start,
  xmax = end, y = molecule, id = gene), on = "genE")

ggplot2::ggplot(example_genes, ggplot2::aes(xmin = start, xmax = end,
    y = molecule, fill = gene)) +
  geom_gene_arrow() +
  ggplot2::geom_blank(data = dummies) +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~ molecule, scales = "free", ncol = 1)
