'gggenes' is a (quite small) set of tools for drawing gene arrow maps with
'ggplot2.'

## Drawing gene arrows with `geom_gene_arrow`

`geom_gene_arrow` is a 'ggplot2' geom that represents genes with arrows. The
start and end locations of the genes within their molecule(s) are mapped to the
`xmin` and `xmax` aesthetics respectively. These start and end locations are
used to determine the directions in which the arrows point. The `y` aesthetic
must be mapped to the molecule(s). If you are drawing more than one molecule,
and the numerical locations of the genes are not similar across molecules, you
almost certainly want to facet the plot with `scales = "free"` to avoid drawing
ridiculously large molecules with ridiculously tiny genes.

```{r geom_gene_arrow, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gggenes)
ggplot(example_genes, aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, y = molecule, fill = gene)) +
  geom_gene_arrow() +
  facet_wrap(~ molecule, scales = "free", ncol = 1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```

## Beautifying the plot with `theme_genes`

Because the resulting plot can look cluttered, a 'ggplot2' theme `theme_genes`
is provided with some sensible defaults.

```{r theme_genes}
ggplot(example_genes, aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, y = molecule, fill = gene)) +
  geom_gene_arrow() +
  facet_wrap(~ molecule, scales = "free", ncol = 1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  theme_genes()
```

## Aligning genes across facets with `make_alignment_dummies`

Often you will want a certain gene to be vertically aligned across the faceted
molecules. `make_alignment_dummies` generates a set of 'dummy' genes that if
added to the plot with `geom_blank` will extend the range of each facet to
visually align the selected gene across facets.

```{r make_alignment_dummies}
dummies <- make_alignment_dummies(
  example_genes,
  aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, y = molecule, id = gene),
  on = "genE"
)

ggplot(example_genes, aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, y = molecule, fill = gene)) +
  geom_gene_arrow() +
  geom_blank(data = dummies) +
  facet_wrap(~ molecule, scales = "free", ncol = 1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  theme_genes()
```

## Labelling genes with `geom_gene_label`

To label individual genes, provide a `label` aesthetic and use
`geom_gene_label`. `geom_gene_label` uses the
['ggfittext'](https://github.com/wilkox/ggfittext) package to fit the label
text inside the gene arrows; see the 'ggfittext' documentation for more details
on how it resizes and reflows text to make it fit.

```{r labelled_genes}
ggplot(example_genes, aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, y =
                                            molecule, fill = gene, label = gene)) +
  geom_gene_arrow(arrowhead_height = unit(3, "mm"), arrowhead_width = unit(1, "mm")) +
  geom_gene_label(align = "left") +
  geom_blank(data = dummies) +
  facet_wrap(~ molecule, scales = "free", ncol = 1) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  theme_genes()
```

## Reversing some genes with the optional `forward` aesthetic

Sometimes you might want to reverse the direction of some genes from that
implied by `xmin` and `xmax`. For example, you might want to draw both a
forward and reverse strand within each facet, and reverse the direction of all
the genes on the reverse strand. The optional `forward` aesthetic is intended
for this sort of situation. 

If `forward` is TRUE (the default), or any value that coerces to TRUE such as
1, the gene will be drawn pointing in the normal direction, i.e. that implied
by `xmin` and `xmax`. If `forward` is FALSE, or any value that coerces to FALSE
such as -1, the gene will be drawn in the reverse of this implied direction. In
the following example, the `forward` aesthetic has been used to reverse the
direction of all genes on the reverse strand from that implied by `xmin` and
`xmax`.

```{r reversing_direction, fig.height = 3}
example_genes$direction <- ifelse(example_genes$strand == "forward", 1, -1)
ggplot(
  subset(example_genes, molecule == "Genome1"),
  aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, y = strand, fill = gene, forward = direction)
  ) +
  geom_gene_arrow() +
  theme_genes()
```
