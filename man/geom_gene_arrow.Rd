\title{A 'ggplot2' geom to draw genes as arrows}
\usage{
geom_gene_arrow(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE, arrowhead_width = grid::unit(4, "mm"),
  arrowhead_height = grid::unit(4, "mm"),
  arrow_body_height = grid::unit(3, "mm"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping, data, stat, position, na.rm, show.legend, inherit.aes, ...}{As
standard for ggplot2.}

\item{arrowhead_width}{grid::unit object giving the width of the arrowhead.
Defaults to 4 mm. If the gene is drawn smaller than this width, only the
arrowhead will be drawn, compressed to the length of the gene.}

\item{arrowhead_height}{grid::unit object giving the height of the arrowhead.
Defaults to 4 mm.}

\item{arrow_body_height}{grid::unit object giving the height of the body of
the arrow. Defaults to 3 mm.}
}
\description{
`geom_gene_arrow` draws genes as arrows, allowing gene maps to be drawn.
}
\details{
This geom draws genes as arrows along a horizontal line representing the
molecule. The start and end locations of the gene are expressed with the
`xmin` and `xmax` aesthetics, while the molecule can be specified with the
`y` aesthetic. Optionally, an additional `forward` aesthetic can be used to
reverse the orientation of some or all genes from that implied by `xmin` and
`xmax`.

Unless the plot is faceted with a free x scale, all the molecules will share
a common x axis. This means that if the locations are very different across
different molecules, the genes might appear very small and squished together
with a lot of unnecessary empty space. To get around this, either facet the
plot with `scales = "free_x"`, or normalise the gene locations if their
exact locations are not important.

See `make_alignment_dummies` for a method to align genes between molecules.

\section{Aesthetics}{


\itemize{
  \item xmin,xmax (start and end of the gene; will be used to determine
        gene orientation)
  \item y (molecule)
  \item forward (if any value that is not TRUE, or coercible to TRUE, the
  gene arrow will be drawn in the opposite direction to that determined by
  `xmin` and `xmax`)
  \item alpha
  \item colour
  \item fill
  \item linetype
  \item size
